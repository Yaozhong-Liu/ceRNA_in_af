# ceRNA_in_af
This repository provides R codes to fully replicate the results in the publication of 'Identifying ceRNA networks associated with the susceptibility and persistence of atrial fibrillation through weighted gene co-expression network analysis'.
Data used in the analyses all come from public available repositories:

The datasets GSE69890 and GSE41177 were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/);

The annotation file including the Ensemble ID, Gene official symbol, and Gene biotype of human genes was created through the Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.99.gtf file downloaded from Ensemble (https://www.ensembl.org/index.html);

The lncRNA/mRNA-miRNA pairs were downloaded from DIANA-LncBase v2.0 (http://www.microrna.gr/LncBase) and DIANA-TarBase v8 (http://www.microrna.gr/tarbase);

Previously identified AF related protein coding genes were obtained from DISEASE (https://diseases.jensenlab.org/Search) , DisgeNET (https://www.disgenet.org/home/), and MALACARD (https://www.malacards.org/) database;

Previsouly identified gene-gene interations in Cardiac muscle were obtained from GIANT project (https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/download);

GO biological process gene sets were downloaded from Molecular Signatures Database v7.2 (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/).
