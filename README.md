#This repository provides R codes to fully replicate the results in the publication of 'Identifying ceRNA networks associated with the susceptibility and persistence of atrial fibrillation through weighted gene co-expression network analysis'.
#The data used in the analyses all comes from public available repositories:

##The datasets GSE69890 and GSE41177 were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/);
#The annotation file including the Ensemble ID, Gene official symbol, and Gene biotype of human genes was created through the Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.99.gtf file downloaded from #Ensemble (https://www.ensembl.org/index.html);
#The lncRNA/mRNA-miRNA pairs were downloaded from DIANA-LncBase v2.0 (http://www.microrna.gr/LncBase) and DIANA-TarBase v8 (http://www.microrna.gr/tarbase);
